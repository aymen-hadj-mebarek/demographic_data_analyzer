# Demographic Data Analysis

This project is a test for the **"Data Analysis with Python"** certificate. The objective is to analyze demographic data to extract meaningful insights and statistics.

## Project Overview

The project involves loading a dataset, performing various calculations, and presenting insights such as:

- The distribution of different races in the dataset.
- The average age of men.
- The percentage of people with Bachelor's degrees.
- The income distribution based on education levels.
- The minimum number of working hours and income analysis for those working the least hours.
- Country-wise analysis of income levels.
- The most popular occupation for high earners in India.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `adult.data.csv`, which contains information about individuals including age, work class, education, race, sex, hours worked per week, and income.

## Key Metrics and Insights

- **Race Distribution**: Counts of each race represented in the dataset.
- **Average Age of Men**: The mean age of male individuals.
- **Percentage with Bachelor's Degree**: Proportion of the dataset with a Bachelor's degree.
- **Income Analysis by Education**:
    - Percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctorate) earning more than 50K.
    - Percentage of people without advanced education earning more than 50K.
- **Minimum Working Hours**: The minimum number of hours worked per week and the income distribution for those working these hours.
- **Country Analysis**:
    - The country with the highest percentage of people earning more than 50K.
- **Top Occupation in India**: The most common occupation among high earners in India.
